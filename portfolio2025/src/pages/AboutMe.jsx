      Hello World! Before entering the tech industry, I served as a social
      worker in the Greater Boston area, helping adults with developmental
      disabilities find and retain employment. My work included collaborating
      with teams to strategize, organize, implement, and troubleshoot issues for
      our clients in a time-sensitive manner. My approach to this role
      prioritized inclusivity and accessibility, which I aim to bring to my new
      role as a software engineer. I'm eager to bring my background and
      expertise to your company, building products that make a positive impact
      in people's lives.
